OVERALL RATING: 6/10 (Good Start, Weak Sustain)

WHAT MAKES IT FUN (COHERENCE - Good Design):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Multi-Path Victory (8/10)
   • 5 independent victory tracks: Wealth, Health, Happiness, Career, Education
   • Players choose own path: Workaholic? Balanced? Well-being focused?
   • All achievable: No impossible gatekeeping
   
✅ Rent Economy (9/10) - STANDOUT SYSTEM
   • Debt/income feedback loop creates organic tension
   • Week 1-4: Comfort (prepaid rent)
   • Week 5+: Crisis (debt accumulates)
   • Forces engagement: Can't idle forever
   • Player agency: Multiple solutions (work, pay lump sum, budget ahead)
   
✅ Housing Tradeoff (7/10)
   • Low-Cost: $305/week (baseline)
   • Security: $445/week (+$140, but 1.5x relaxation at home)
   • Real choice: Money vs. comfort
   
✅ Job Progression (6/10)
   • Clear ladder: Rank 1 (no skills) → Rank 8 ($25/hour)
   • Consistent scaling: Each rank needs predictable education/experience
   • Rewarding: "Promotion!" feels real
   
✅ Time Constraint (7/10)
   • 600 time units/week = hard limit on actions
   • Forces meaningful choices: Work? Study? Relax? Can't do all
   • Flexible Work: Can work 1, 4, 8, or 12 hours for tactical control


WHAT BREAKS THE FUN (INCOHERENCE - Bad Design):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔴 CRITICAL: Work Without Consequence (Severity: 10/10)
   Problem: Working doesn't reduce health or happiness
   Impact: Health/Happiness victory = just 1 hour of relaxing (trivial)
   Result: Strategic depth DESTROYED. Work becomes optimal everywhere.
   Example: "Work 100 hours, relax 1 hour, win" - no interesting choices
   Fix: Restore 2 health loss per work hour
   
🔴 CRITICAL: Dead Stat - experienceGainPerHour (Severity: 8/10)
   Problem: All jobs define exp gain rate, but it's NEVER USED
   Impact: No job differentiation; all jobs give same exp/hour
   Result: Job selection = just pick highest wage (no strategy)
   Fix: Make it functional OR remove it (don't ship dead code)
   
🔴 CRITICAL: Duplicate Rent Payment (Severity: 8/10)
   Problem: Two conflicting rent systems
   • PayRentAction: 5 time units, full debt only
   • RentAgency: 0 time units, partial payment allowed
   Impact: Players will always use free option (0-cost exploit)
   Result: Rent payment becomes effortless; time cost meaningless
   Fix: Consolidate to single system with real tradeoff

🟠 MAJOR: Location Effects Inconsistent (Severity: 6/10)
   Problem: Only Relax responds to location (home bonus 1.5x)
   Impact: Work/Study indifferent to location
   Result: All factories identical except wages; no location strategy
   Fix: Add location multipliers to Work/Study

🟠 MAJOR: Work Time Limits Unclear (Severity: 6/10)
   Problem: Can a player work 120 hours/week? (Not documented)
   Impact: Confusing mechanic; potential exploit or broken feeling
   Fix: Clarify limits and add validation

🟡 MODERATE: Study Lacks Variety (Severity: 4/10)
   Problem: All study costs $15, takes 20 time units, gives 1 education
   Impact: Study is boring checkbox; no strategic variation
   Fix: Add multiple colleges with different cost/benefit

🟡 MODERATE: Stock Trading Not Implemented (Severity: 4/10)
   Problem: UI shows "Stock Trading (coming soon)" - it's a placeholder
   Impact: Promised feature missing; no alternate wealth path
   Fix: Implement buy/sell mechanics with price volatility


GAME PHASE BREAKDOWN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Weeks 1-3 (Early):   8/10 - EXCELLENT
   Fresh systems, discover mechanics, rent pressure creates urgency

Weeks 4-8 (Mid):    6/10 - BORING
   Strategy solved, repetition sets in, dominant path emerges

Weeks 9+ (Late):    5/10 - TEDIOUS
   Optimal play clear ("work more"), no failure risk, waiting to win


KEY DECISION QUALITY:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MEANINGFUL:                          HOLLOW:
✓ Housing choice (money vs comfort)  ✗ Job choice (just pick wage leader)
✓ Career path (shapes play style)    ✗ Study timing (binary yes/no)
✓ Weekly time budget (resource puzzle) ✗ Work hours (optimized away)
✓ Rent management (dynamic pressure)  ✗ Clothing (requirement check only)


RECOMMENDATIONS (Priority Order):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MUST FIX (2-4 hrs each):
1. Restore work health loss (2 health/hour) → Fixes core tension
2. Consolidate rent payment → Removes exploit, restores time cost
3. Document work limits → Clarifies mechanics, prevents confusion

SHOULD FIX (4-8 hrs each):
4. Use experienceGainPerHour in code → Differentiates jobs
5. Add location multipliers → Makes location selection matter
6. Implement stock trading → Completes promised feature

NICE TO HAVE (8+ hrs):
7. Add study variation (multiple colleges)
8. Implement failure states (debt spiral, job loss)
9. Add consequence systems (hunger, stress, health crisis)


CONCLUSION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VERDICT: Good bones, poor execution

The game has EXCELLENT conceptual design (rent economy, multi-path victory, 
time constraint) but WEAK tactical execution (work without consequence, dead 
code, unfinished features, dominant strategies).

It's fun for 2-3 sessions then becomes repetitive.

POTENTIAL: With fixes (especially work health loss + consolidation), this could
be a 9/10 game. The mechanics are sound; they just need refinement.

Current: 6/10 (Decent game with implementation issues)
Target: 9/10 (Excellent replayable simulation)

Gap: Fixable with 30-40 hours of targeted work
